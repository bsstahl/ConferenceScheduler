# ConferenceScheduler

A NetStandard2.0 compliant schedule optimizer for small conferences and code camps.

This project was forked from the RobRich\ConferenceScheduler repository, which included this optimizer inside a web site. 
The goal of forking the project was to pull the optimizer piece out from under the website and make it available
as a stand-alone package for use in any .NET project.
